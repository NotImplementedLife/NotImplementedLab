        This activity is a particular application of the following (invented) problem:<LineBreak/><LineBreak/>        
        Let there be a country whose cities are arranged as suggested by an N*M grid. The cities are connected by roads such that there 
        exists a road only between two adjacent cities on the map. Therefore, a city <Run FontFamily="Consolas">(i,j)</Run> is connected to at most 4 cities: 
        <Run FontFamily="Consolas">(i-1,j)</Run>, <Run FontFamily="Consolas">(i+1,j)</Run>, <Run FontFamily="Consolas">(i,j-1)</Run>, <Run FontFamily="Consolas">(i,j+1)</Run>.
        A huge sandstorm hit the country and severly covered all the roads with sand. The authorities calculated the cost for cleaning each road. Their goal is to
        clean the roads such that there should exist a clean path linking every two cities. They also want to do this at a minimum cost. Find a possible roads 
        cleaning configurtion.
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        The solution is to apply <Hyperlink RequestNavigate="Hyperlink_RequestNavigate" NavigateUri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm">Prim's algorithm</Hyperlink>
        on the graph consisting of the N*M cities and the corresponding roads. The activity provides a simulation with visual feedback of the algorithm. Also note
        that the final set of selected edges forms a delightful connex maze.
